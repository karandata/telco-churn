## Churn Analysis on the Telco dataset from kaggle.com

For the best results, start with the churn_EDA.md. 

This file shows my work for the Exploratory Data Analysis. At the end there is an extra little section where I used KMeans clustering, and with the best k clusters, I was able to give a description of the cluster groups.

Next you can view the churn_Model.md where I provide a prediction model. I use a business case to see if the model can actually provide value to the Telco company.
